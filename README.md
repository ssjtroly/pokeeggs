# pokeeggs
Pokémon tool to find compatible Pokémon for creating eggs.
This project can be found live [here](https://ssjtroly.github.io/pokeeggs/).

Selecting a Pokémon will populate a list of all other Pokémon with which it can create eggs. The information is based entirely on egg grouping and may or may not be accurate.

Thanks goes to fanzeyi for [pokemon.json](https://github.com/fanzeyi/pokemon.json).
